# Instructions

Hi there!
I uploaded a project I did just before I went to university, so I think its in 2021. 
You just move the mouse around, which is the light source, and see the shadow and light effect.

Anyway, to run the project, just run it from main.py.
You will need:
- At least Python 3.7
- Pygame library installed

It's just a demonstration of light and shadow on different objects, nothing too fancy but I liked it quite a lot!
