# Instructions

Hi there!
I uploaded a project I did just before I went to university, so I think its in 2021.

Anyway, to run the project, just run it from main.py.
You will need:
- At least Python 3.7
- Pygame library installed

It's just a demonstration of light and shadow on different objects, nothing too fancy but I liked it quite a lot!
